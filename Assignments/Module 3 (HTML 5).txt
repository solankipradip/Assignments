Q4=Canvas and SVG tags

Ans- Canvas:
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page.
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

Syntext:	<canvas id="" width="" height=""></canvas>


SVG:
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
SVG is used to define graphics for the Web
SVG is a W3C recommendation

Differences Between SVG and Canvas
SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.

Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript).

SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.

In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.

Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser. If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.
